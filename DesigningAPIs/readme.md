- start with empty and separate projects.
- focus on products and provide seed with db data and everything but an empty controller, services and repository


- present rest, what is
- talk about HTTP REST contraints and all
- - status codes
- how to design the api endpoints


____________________
- implement the REST endpoint for Products toghether
- document the endpoints with Produces

`
[ProducesResponseType(204)]
[ProducesResponseType(400)]
[ProducesResponseType(404)]
`
- then add ProductReviews
- then add Product Categories
- then add Product Images - hard to implement
- then add Product Tags - seems a good idea
- then add Product Variants

-----------

- implement the services and repositories for the products
- add caching to the products Repo - in memory JPrince
- maybe add another variant with RedisCache or talk about it
- emphasize that we can filter products based on REST spects on query string. Modify parameters and add IQueryable to the repo for the	
GetAll method
- add your Own ProblemDetails 

- Test everything: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/test/http-files?view=aspnetcore-8.0

- come back to slides and show how important is the Accept-header, and how to implement it in the controller											
by adding XML output formatter and test it again.

- implement the Customer endpoint
- implement the services and repositories for the customers
- add caching to the customers Repo - in memory JPrince
- start adding library that obfuscated the ids in the browser

Log levels can be set for the namespace in which the functionality is defined. Nested namespaces allow us to control which functionality has logging enabled:

Microsoft: Include all log types in the Microsoft namespace.
Microsoft.AspNetCore: Include all log types in the Microsoft.AspNetCore namespace.
Microsoft.AspNetCore.HttpLogging: Include all log types in the Microsoft.AspNetCore. HttpLogging namespace.
Letï¿½s see HTTP logging in action:

- adding Odata

- adding GraphQL

= add a http client in the mvc ui project
builder.Services.AddHttpClient(name: "Northwind.WebApi",
  configureClient: options =>
  {
    options.BaseAddress = new Uri("https://localhost:5151/");
    options.DefaultRequestHeaders.Accept.Add(
